        I am a seasoned game developer with a track record of enhancing core mechanics, 
        implementing and programming UIs, creating diverse visual effects, 
        and crafting level editors. Additionally, I excel in producing compelling 
        CPI videos and overseeing the seamless publication of games on various app stores. 
        I developed all the games below while working professionally with Product Managers,
        2D/3D Artists and Game Designers.
